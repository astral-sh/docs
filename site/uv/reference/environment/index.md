The validation modes to use when run with `--compile`.

See [`PycInvalidationMode`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/py_compile.html#py_compile.PycInvalidationMode).

### [`PYTHONPATH`](#pythonpath)

added in `0.1.22`

Adds directories to Python module search path (e.g., `PYTHONPATH=/path/to/modules`).

### [`PYX_API_KEY`](#pyx_api_key)

The pyx API key (e.g., `sk-pyx-...`).

### [`PYX_API_URL`](#pyx_api_url)

added in `0.8.15`

The URL of the pyx Simple API server.

### [`PYX_AUTH_TOKEN`](#pyx_auth_token)

### [`PYX_CDN_DOMAIN`](#pyx_cdn_domain)

added in `0.8.15`

The domain of the pyx CDN.

### [`PYX_CREDENTIALS_DIR`](#pyx_credentials_dir)

added in `0.8.15`

Specifies the directory where uv stores pyx credentials.

### [`RUST_BACKTRACE`](#rust_backtrace)

added in `0.7.22`

If set, it can be used to display more stack trace details when a panic occurs. This is used by uv particularly on windows to show more details during a platform exception.

For example:

- `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` will print a short backtrace.
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` will print a full backtrace.

See the [Rust backtrace documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html) for more.

### [`RUST_LOG`](#rust_log)

added in `0.0.5`

If set, uv will use this value as the log level for its `--verbose` output. Accepts any filter compatible with the `tracing_subscriber` crate.

For example:

- `RUST_LOG=uv=debug` is the equivalent of adding `--verbose` to the command line
- `RUST_LOG=trace` will enable trace-level logging.

See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#example-syntax) for more.

### [`RUST_MIN_STACK`](#rust_min_stack)

added in `0.5.19`

Use to set the stack size used by uv.

The value is in bytes, and if both `UV_STACK_SIZE` are `RUST_MIN_STACK` unset, uv uses a 4MB (4194304) stack. `UV_STACK_SIZE` takes precedence over `RUST_MIN_STACK`.

Prefer setting `UV_STACK_SIZE`, since `RUST_MIN_STACK` also affects subprocesses, such as build backends that use Rust code.

Unlike the normal `RUST_MIN_STACK` semantics, this can affect main thread stack size, because we actually spawn our own main2 thread to work around the fact that Windows' real main thread is only 1MB. That thread has size `max(RUST_MIN_STACK, 1MB)`.

### [`SHELL`](#shell)

added in `0.1.16`

The standard `SHELL` posix env var.

### [`SSL_CERT_FILE`](#ssl_cert_file)

added in `0.1.14`

Custom certificate bundle file path for SSL connections.

### [`SSL_CLIENT_CERT`](#ssl_client_cert)

added in `0.2.11`

If set, uv will use this file for mTLS authentication. This should be a single file containing both the certificate and the private key in PEM format.

### [`SYSTEMDRIVE`](#systemdrive)

added in `0.4.26`

Path to system-level configuration directory on Windows systems.

### [`TRACING_DURATIONS_FILE`](#tracing_durations_file)

added in `0.0.5`

Use to create the tracing durations file via the `tracing-durations-export` feature.

### [`USERPROFILE`](#userprofile)

added in `0.0.5`

Path to root directory of user's profile on Windows systems.

### [`UV`](#uv)

added in `0.6.0`

The path to the binary that was used to invoke uv.

This is propagated to all subprocesses spawned by uv.

If the executable was invoked through a symbolic link, some platforms will return the path of the symbolic link and other platforms will return the path of the symbolic link’s target.

See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.current_exe.html#security> for security considerations.

### [`VIRTUAL_ENV`](#virtual_env)

added in `0.0.5`

Used to detect an activated virtual environment.

### [`VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT`](#virtual_env_disable_prompt)

added in `0.0.5`

If set to `1` before a virtual environment is activated, then the virtual environment name will not be prepended to the terminal prompt.

### [`XDG_BIN_HOME`](#xdg_bin_home)

added in `0.2.16`

Path to directory where executables are installed.

### [`XDG_CACHE_HOME`](#xdg_cache_home)

added in `0.1.17`
