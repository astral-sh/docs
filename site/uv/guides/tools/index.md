# [Using tools](#using-tools)

Many Python packages provide applications that can be used as tools. uv has specialized support for easily invoking and installing tools.

## [Running tools](#running-tools)

The `uvx` command invokes a tool without installing it.

For example, to run `ruff`:

```
$ uvx ruff

```

Note

This is exactly equivalent to:

```
$ uv tool run ruff

```

`uvx` is provided as an alias for convenience.

Arguments can be provided after the tool name:

```
$ uvx pycowsay hello from uv

  -------------
< hello from uv >
  -------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||

```

Tools are installed into temporary, isolated environments when using `uvx`.

Note

If you are running a tool in a [*project*](../../concepts/projects/) and the tool requires that your project is installed, e.g., when using `pytest` or `mypy`, you'll want to use [`uv run`](../projects/#running-commands) instead of `uvx`. Otherwise, the tool will be run in a virtual environment that is isolated from your project.

If your project has a flat structure, e.g., instead of using a `src` directory for modules, the project itself does not need to be installed and `uvx` is fine. In this case, using `uv run` is only beneficial if you want to pin the version of the tool in the project's dependencies.

## [Commands with different package names](#commands-with-different-package-names)

When `uvx ruff` is invoked, uv installs the `ruff` package which provides the `ruff` command. However, sometimes the package and command names differ.

The `--from` option can be used to invoke a command from a specific package, e.g., `http` which is provided by `httpie`:

```
$ uvx --from httpie http

```

## [Requesting specific versions](#requesting-specific-versions)

To run a tool at a specific version, use `command@<version>`:

```
$ uvx ruff@0.3.0 check

```

To run a tool at the latest version, use `command@latest`:

```
$ uvx ruff@latest check

```

The `--from` option can also be used to specify package versions, as above:

```
$ uvx --from 'ruff==0.3.0' ruff check

```

Or, to constrain to a range of versions:

```
$ uvx --from 'ruff>0.2.0,<0.3.0' ruff check

```

Note the `@` syntax cannot be used for anything other than an exact version.

## [Requesting extras](#requesting-extras)

The `--from` option can be used to run a tool with extras:

```
$ uvx --from 'mypy[faster-cache,reports]' mypy --xml-report mypy_report

```

This can also be combined with version selection:

```
$ uvx --from 'mypy[faster-cache,reports]==1.13.0' mypy --xml-report mypy_report

```

## [Requesting different sources](#requesting-different-sources)

The `--from` option can also be used to install from alternative sources.

For example, to pull from git:

```
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli httpie

```

You can also pull the latest commit from a specific named branch:

```
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli@master httpie

```

Or pull a specific tag:

```
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli@3.2.4 httpie

```

Or even a specific commit:

```
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli@2843b87 httpie

```

Or with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) support:

```
$ uvx --lfs --from git+https://github.com/astral-sh/lfs-cowsay lfs-cowsay

```

## [Commands with plugins](#commands-with-plugins)

Additional dependencies can be included, e.g., to include `mkdocs-material` when running `mkdocs`:

```
$ uvx --with mkdocs-material mkdocs --help

```

## [Installing tools](#installing-tools)

If a tool is used often, it is useful to install it to a persistent environment and add it to the `PATH` instead of invoking `uvx` repeatedly.

Tip

`uvx` is a convenient alias for `uv tool run`. All of the other commands for interacting with tools require the full `uv tool` prefix.

To install `ruff`:

```
$ uv tool install ruff

```

When a tool is installed, its executables are placed in a `bin` directory in the `PATH` which allows the tool to be run without uv. If it's not on the `PATH`, a warning will be displayed and `uv tool update-shell` can be used to add it to the `PATH`.

After installing `ruff`, it should be available:

```
$ ruff --version

```

Unlike `uv pip install`, installing a tool does not make its modules available in the current environment. For example, the following command will fail:

```
$ python -c "import ruff"

```

This isolation is important for reducing interactions and conflicts between dependencies of tools, scripts, and projects.

Unlike `uvx`, `uv tool install` operates on a *package* and will install all executables provided by the tool.

For example, the following will install the `http`, `https`, and `httpie` executables:

```
$ uv tool install httpie

```

Additionally, package versions can be included without `--from`:

```
$ uv tool install 'httpie>0.1.0'

```

And, similarly, for package sources:

```
$ uv tool install git+https://github.com/httpie/cli

```

Or package sources with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com):

```
$ uv tool install --lfs git+https://github.com/astral-sh/lfs-cowsay

```

As with `uvx`, installations can include additional packages:

```
$ uv tool install mkdocs --with mkdocs-material

```

Multiple related executables can be installed together in the same tool environment, using the `--with-executables-from` flag. For example, the following will install the executables from `ansible`, plus those ones provided by `ansible-core` and `ansible-lint`:

```
$ uv tool install --with-executables-from ansible-core,ansible-lint ansible

```

## [Upgrading tools](#upgrading-tools)

To upgrade a tool, use `uv tool upgrade`:

```
$ uv tool upgrade ruff

```

Tool upgrades will respect the version constraints provided when installing the tool. For example, `uv tool install ruff >=0.3,<0.4` followed by `uv tool upgrade ruff` will upgrade Ruff to the latest version in the range `>=0.3,<0.4`.

To instead replace the version constraints, re-install the tool with `uv tool install`:

```
$ uv tool install ruff>=0.4

```

To instead upgrade all tools:

```
$ uv tool upgrade --all

```

## [Requesting Python versions](#requesting-python-versions)

By default, uv will use your default Python interpreter (the first it finds) when running, installing, or upgrading tools. You can specify the Python interpreter to use with the `--python` option.

For example, to request a specific Python version when running a tool:

```
$ uvx --python 3.10 ruff

```

Or, when installing a tool:

```
$ uv tool install --python 3.10 ruff

```

Or, when upgrading a tool:

```
$ uv tool upgrade --python 3.10 ruff

```

For more details on requesting Python versions, see the [Python version](../../concepts/python-versions/#requesting-a-version) concept page.

## [Legacy Windows Scripts](#legacy-windows-scripts)

Tools also support running [legacy setuptools scripts](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#scripts). These scripts are available via `$(uv tool dir)\<tool-name>\Scripts` when installed.

Currently only legacy scripts with the `.ps1`, `.cmd`, and `.bat` extensions are supported.

For example, below is an example running a Command Prompt script.

```
$ uv tool run --from nuitka==2.6.7 nuitka.cmd --version

```

In addition, you don't need to specify the extension. `uvx` will automatically look for files ending in `.ps1`, `.cmd`, and `.bat` in that order of execution on your behalf.

```
$ uv tool run --from nuitka==2.6.7 nuitka --version

```
