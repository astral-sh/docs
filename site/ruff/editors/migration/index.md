# [Migrating from `ruff-lsp`](#migrating-from-ruff-lsp)

[`ruff-lsp`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) is the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) implementation for Ruff to power the editor integrations. It is written in Python and is a separate package from Ruff itself. The **native server**, however, is the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) implementation which is **written in Rust** and is available under the `ruff server` command. This guide is intended to help users migrate from [`ruff-lsp`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) to the native server.

Note

The native server was first introduced in Ruff version `0.3.5`. It was marked as [beta in version `0.4.5`](https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.4.5) and officially [stabilized in version `0.5.3`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.5.3). It is recommended to use the latest version of Ruff to ensure the best experience.

The migration process involves any or all of the following:

1. Migrate [deprecated settings](#unsupported-settings) to the [new settings](#new-settings)
1. [Remove settings](#removed-settings) that are no longer supported
1. Update the `ruff` version

Read on to learn more about the unsupported or new settings, or jump to the [examples](#examples) that enumerate some of the common settings and how to migrate them.

## [Unsupported Settings](#unsupported-settings)

The following [`ruff-lsp`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) settings are not supported by the native server:

- [`lint.run`](../settings/#lintrun): This setting is no longer relevant for the native language server, which runs on every keystroke by default.
- [`lint.args`](../settings/#lintargs), [`format.args`](../settings/#formatargs): These settings have been replaced by more granular settings in the native server like [`lint.select`](../settings/#select), [`format.preview`](../settings/#format_preview), etc. along with the ability to override any configuration using the [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration) setting.

The following settings are not accepted by the language server but are still used by the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode). Refer to their respective documentation for more information on how each is used by the extension:

- [`path`](../settings/#path)
- [`interpreter`](../settings/#interpreter)

## [Removed Settings](#removed-settings)

Additionally, the following settings are not supported by the native server and should be removed:

- [`ignoreStandardLibrary`](../settings/#ignorestandardlibrary)
- [`showNotifications`](../settings/#shownotifications)

## [New Settings](#new-settings)

The native server introduces several new settings that [`ruff-lsp`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) does not have:

- [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration)
- [`configurationPreference`](../settings/#configurationpreference)
- [`exclude`](../settings/#exclude)
- [`format.preview`](../settings/#format_preview)
- [`lineLength`](../settings/#linelength)
- [`lint.select`](../settings/#select)
- [`lint.extendSelect`](../settings/#extendselect)
- [`lint.ignore`](../settings/#ignore)
- [`lint.preview`](../settings/#lint_preview)

## [Examples](#examples)

All of the examples mentioned below are only valid for the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode). For other editors, please refer to their respective documentation sections in the [settings](../settings/) page.

### [Configuration file](#configuration-file)

If you've been providing a configuration file as shown below:

```
{
    "ruff.lint.args": "--config ~/.config/custom_ruff_config.toml",
    "ruff.format.args": "--config ~/.config/custom_ruff_config.toml"
}
```

You can migrate to the new server by using the [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration) setting like below which will apply the configuration to both the linter and the formatter:

```
{
    "ruff.configuration": "~/.config/custom_ruff_config.toml"
}
```

### [`lint.args`](#lintargs)

If you're providing the linter flags by using `ruff.lint.args` like so:

```
{
    "ruff.lint.args": "--select=E,F --unfixable=F401 --unsafe-fixes"
}
```

You can migrate to the new server by using the [`lint.select`](../settings/#select) and [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration) setting like so:

```
{
    "ruff.lint.select": ["E", "F"],
    "ruff.configuration": {
        "unsafe-fixes": true,
        "lint": {
            "unfixable": ["F401"]
        }
    }
}
```

The following options can be set directly in the editor settings:

- [`lint.select`](../settings/#select)
- [`lint.extendSelect`](../settings/#extendselect)
- [`lint.ignore`](../settings/#ignore)
- [`lint.preview`](../settings/#lint_preview)

The remaining options can be set using the [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration) setting.

### [`format.args`](#formatargs)

If you're also providing formatter flags by using `ruff.format.args` like so:

```
{
    "ruff.format.args": "--line-length 80 --config='format.quote-style=double'"
}
```

You can migrate to the new server by using the [`lineLength`](../settings/#linelength) and [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration) setting like so:

```
{
    "ruff.lineLength": 80,
    "ruff.configuration": {
        "format": {
            "quote-style": "double"
        }
    }
}
```

The following options can be set directly in the editor settings:

- [`lineLength`](../settings/#linelength)
- [`format.preview`](../settings/#format_preview)

The remaining options can be set using the [`configuration`](../settings/#configuration) setting.
