# [Configuration](#configuration)

## [Configuration files](#configuration-files)

ty supports persistent configuration files at both the project- and user-level.

Specifically, ty will search for a `pyproject.toml` or `ty.toml` file in the current directory, or in the nearest parent directory.

If a `pyproject.toml` file is found, ty will read configuration from the `[tool.ty]` table. For example, to ignore the `index-out-of-bounds` rule, add the following to a `pyproject.toml`:

pyproject.toml

```
[tool.ty.rules]
index-out-of-bounds = "ignore"

```

Note

If there is no `tool.ty` table, the `pyproject.toml` file will be ignored, and ty will continue searching in the directory hierarchy.

ty will also search for `ty.toml` files, which follow an identical structure, but omit the `[tool.ty]` prefix. For example:

ty.toml

```
[rules]
index-out-of-bounds = "ignore"

```

Important

`ty.toml` files take precedence over `pyproject.toml` files, so if both `ty.toml` and `pyproject.toml` files are present in a directory, configuration will be read from `ty.toml`, and the `[tool.ty]` section in the accompanying `pyproject.toml` will be ignored.

ty will also discover user-level configuration at `~/.config/ty/ty.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ty/ty.toml`) on macOS and Linux, or `%APPDATA%\ty\ty.toml` on Windows. User-level configuration must use the `ty.toml` format, rather than the `pyproject.toml` format, as a `pyproject.toml` is intended to define a Python project.

If project- and user-level configuration files are found, the settings will be merged, with project-level configuration taking precedence over the user-level configuration.

For example, if a string, number, or boolean is present in both the project- and user-level configuration tables, the project-level value will be used, and the user-level value will be ignored. If an array is present in both tables, the arrays will be merged, with the project-level settings appearing later in the merged array.

Settings provided via command line take precedence over persistent configuration.

See the [configuration](../reference/configuration/) reference for an enumeration of the available settings.
