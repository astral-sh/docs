# [Typing FAQ](#typing-faq)

This page answers some commonly asked questions about ty and Python's type system.

## [Why does ty report an error on my code?](#why-does-ty-report-an-error-on-my-code)

Check the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/) for the specific error code you are seeing; it may explain the problem.

## [What is the `Unknown` type and when does it appear?](#what-is-the-unknown-type-and-when-does-it-appear)

`Unknown` is ty's way of representing a type that could not be fully inferred. It behaves the same way as `Any`, but appears implicitly, rather than through an explicit `Any` annotation:

```
from missing_module import MissingClass  # error: unresolved-import

reveal_type(MissingClass)  # Unknown

```

ty also uses unions with `Unknown` to maintain the [gradual guarantee](../../features/type-system/#gradual-guarantee), which helps avoid false positive errors in untyped code while still providing useful type information where possible.

For example, consider the following untyped `Message` class (which could come from a third-party dependency that you have no control over). ty treats the `data` attribute as having type `Unknown | None`, since there is no type annotation that restricts it further. The `Unknown` in the union allows ty to avoid raising errors on the `msg.data = …` assignment. On the other hand, the `None` in the union reflects the fact that `data` *could* possibly be `None`, and requires code that uses `msg.data` to handle that case explicitly.

```
class Message:
    data = None

    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title


def receive(msg: Message):
    reveal_type(msg.data)  # Unknown | None


msg = Message("Favorite color")
msg.data = {"color": "blue"}

```

## [Why does ty show `int | float` when I annotate something as `float`?](#why-does-ty-show-int-float-when-i-annotate-something-as-float)

The [Python typing specification](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/special-types.html) includes a special rule for numeric types where an `int` can be used wherever a `float` is expected:

```
def circle_area(radius: float) -> float:
    return 3.14 * radius * radius

circle_area(2)      # OK: int is allowed where float is expected

```

This rule is a special case, since `int` is not actually a subclass of `float`. To support this, ty treats `float` annotations as meaning `int | float`. Unlike some other type checkers, ty makes this behavior explicit in type hints and error messages. For example, if you [hover over the `radius` parameter](https://play.ty.dev/fdc144c6-031c-4af9-b520-a4c6ccde9261), ty will show `int | float`.

A similar rule applies to `complex`, which is treated as `int | float | complex`.

Info

These special rules for `float` and `complex` exist for a reason. In almost all cases, you probably want to accept both `int` and `float` when you annotate something as `float`. If you really need to accept *only* `float` and not `int`, you can use ty's `JustFloat` type. At the time of writing, this import needs to be guarded by a `TYPE_CHECKING` block:

```
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from ty_extensions import JustFloat
else:
    JustFloat = float

def only_actual_floats_allowed(f: JustFloat) -> None: ...

only_actual_floats_allowed(1.0)  # OK
only_actual_floats_allowed(1)    # error: invalid-argument-type

```

([Full example in the playground](https://play.ty.dev/fb034780-3ba7-4c6a-9449-5b0f44128bab))

If you need this for `complex`, you can use `ty_extensions.JustComplex` in a similar way.

## [Why does ty say `Callable` has no attribute `__name__`?](#why-does-ty-say-callable-has-no-attribute-__name__)

When you access `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__module__`, or `__doc__` on a value typed as `Callable`, ty reports an `unresolved-attribute` error. This is because not all callables have these attributes. Functions do (including lambdas), but other callable objects do not. The `FileUpload` class below, for example, is callable, but instances of `FileUpload` do not have a `__name__` attribute. Passing a `FileUpload` instance to `retry` would lead to an `AttributeError` at runtime.

```
from typing import Callable

def retry(times: int, operation: Callable[[], bool]) -> bool:
    for i in range(times):
        # WRONG: `operation` does not necessarily have a `__name__` attribute
        print(f"Calling {operation.__name__}, attempt {i + 1} of {times}")
        if operation():
            return True
    return False

class FileUpload:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        # …

    def __call__(self) -> bool:
        # …

retry(3, FileUpload("image.png"))

```

To fix this, you could use `getattr` with a fall back to a default name when the attribute is not present (or use a `hasattr(…, "__name__")` check if you access it multiple times):

```
name = getattr(operation, "__name__", "operation")

```

Alternatively, you could use an `isinstance(…, types.FunctionType)` check to narrow the type of `operation` to something that definitely has a `__name__` attribute:

```
if isinstance(operation, FunctionType):
    print(f"Calling {operation.__name__}, attempt {i + 1} of {times}")
else:
    print(f"Calling operation, attempt {i + 1} of {times}")

```

You can try various approaches in [this playground example](https://play.ty.dev/f6f7f35a-47c3-423d-be8d-33d03c61d40c). See also [this discussion](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1495) for some plans to improve the developer experience around this in the future.

Info

ty has first-class support for intersection types. If you only want to accept function-like callables, you could define `FunctionLikeCallable` as an intersection of `Callable` and `types.FunctionType`:

```
from typing import Callable, TYPE_CHECKING
from types import FunctionType

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from ty_extensions import Intersection

    type FunctionLikeCallable[**P, R] = Intersection[Callable[P, R], FunctionType]
else:
    FunctionLikeCallable = Callable


def retry(times: int, operation: FunctionLikeCallable[[], bool]) -> bool:
    ...

```

You can check out the full example [here](https://play.ty.dev/7a1ea4ab-04e1-4271-adf5-ddc3a5d2fcfd), which demonstrates that `FileUpload` instances are no longer accepted by `retry`.

## [Does ty have a strict mode?](#does-ty-have-a-strict-mode)

Not yet. A stricter inference mode is tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1240). In the meantime, you can consider using Ruff's [`flake8-annotations` rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-annotations-ann) to enforce more explicit type annotations in your code.

## [Why doesn't ty warn about missing type annotations?](#why-doesnt-ty-warn-about-missing-type-annotations)

ty does not report an error for unannotated function parameters, return types, or variables. When ty encounters an unannotated symbol, it infers the type as [`Unknown`](#what-is-the-unknown-type-and-when-does-it-appear) while still providing useful diagnostics where possible.

If you are looking for the equivalent of mypy's [`disallow_untyped_defs`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-disallow_untyped_defs) (error code: `no-untyped-def`), Ruff provides this as a set of opt-in lint rules via its [`flake8-annotations` (`ANN`)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-annotations-ann) rule group.

Some rules you might find useful include:

- [`ANN001`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-type-function-argument/): Missing type annotation for function argument
- [`ANN002`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-type-args/): Missing type annotation for `*args`
- [`ANN003`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-type-kwargs/): Missing type annotation for `**kwargs`
- [`ANN201`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-return-type-undocumented-public-function/): Missing return type annotation for public function
- [`ANN202`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-return-type-private-function/): Missing return type annotation for private function
- [`RUF045`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/implicit-class-var-in-dataclass/): Implicit class variable in dataclass

## [Why can't ty resolve my imports?](#why-cant-ty-resolve-my-imports)

Import resolution issues are often caused by a missing or incorrect environment configuration. When ty reports *"Cannot resolve imported module …"*, check the following:

1. **Virtual environment**: Make sure your virtual environment is discoverable. ty looks for an active virtual environment via `VIRTUAL_ENV` or a `.venv` directory in your project root. See the [module discovery](../../modules/#python-environment) documentation for more details.

1. **Project structure**: If your source code is not in the project root or `src/` directory, configure [`environment.root`](../configuration/#root) in your `pyproject.toml`:

   ```
   [tool.ty.environment]
   root = ["./app"]

   ```

1. **Third-party packages**: Ensure dependencies are installed in your virtual environment. Run ty with `-v` to see the search paths being used.

1. **Compiled extensions**: ty requires `.py` or `.pyi` files for type information. If a package contains only compiled extensions (`.so` or `.pyd` files), you'll need stub files (`.pyi`) for ty to understand the types. See also [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/487) which tracks improvements in this area.

## [Does ty support monorepos?](#does-ty-support-monorepos)

ty can work with monorepos, but automatic discovery of nested projects is limited. By default, ty uses the current working directory or the `--project` option to determine the project root.

For monorepos with multiple Python packages, you have a few options:

1. **Run ty per-package**: Run `ty check` from each package directory, or use `--project` to specify the package:

   ```
   ty check --project packages/package-a
   ty check --project packages/package-b

   ```

1. **Configure multiple source roots**: Use [`environment.root`](../configuration/#root) to specify multiple source directories:

   ```
   [tool.ty.environment]
   root = ["packages/package-a", "packages/package-b"]

   ```

   This has the disadvantage of treating all packages as a single project, which may lead to cases in which ty thinks something is importable when it wouldn't be at runtime.

You can follow [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/819) to get updates on this topic.

## [Does ty support PEP 723 inline-metadata scripts?](#does-ty-support-pep-723-inline-metadata-scripts)

It depends on what you want to do. If you have a single inline-metadata script, you can type check it with ty by using uv's `--with-requirements` flag to install the dependencies specified in the script header:

```
uvx --with-requirements script.py ty check script.py

```

If you have multiple scripts in your workspace, ty does not yet recognize that they have different dependencies based on their inline metadata.

You can follow [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/691) for updates.

## [Is there a pre-commit hook for ty?](#is-there-a-pre-commit-hook-for-ty)

Not yet. You can track progress in [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/269), which also includes some suggested manual hooks you can use in the meantime.

## [Does ty support (mypy) plugins?](#does-ty-support-mypy-plugins)

No. ty does not have a plugin system and there is currently no plan to add one.

We prefer extending the type system with well-specified features rather than relying on type-checker-specific plugins. That said, we are considering adding support for popular third-party libraries like pydantic, SQLAlchemy, attrs, or django directly into ty.

## [What is `Top[list[Unknown]]`, and why does it appear?](#what-is-toplistunknown-and-why-does-it-appear)

This type represents "all possible lists of any element type" (as opposed to `list[Unknown]`, which represents "a list of some unknown element type"). It usually arises from a check such as `if isinstance(x, list):`. If `x` was previously of type `Item | list[Item]`, you might expect this check to narrow the type to `list[Item]`, but ty respects the possibility that there could be a common subclass of both `Item` and `list` (which may not be a list of `Item`!), and so the narrowed type is instead `(Item & Top[list[Unknown]]) | list[Item]`. This code can be made more robust by instead checking `if instance(x, Item)`, or by declaring the `Item` type as `@typing.final`.

See also the [discussion here](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#top-and-bottom-materializations) and [in this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1578).
