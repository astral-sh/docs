# [Exit codes](#exit-codes)

The ty command line interface uses the following exit codes:

| Exit code | Description | | --- | --- | | `0` | no violations with severity `error` or higher were found | | `1` | violations with severity `error` or higher were found | | `2` | invalid CLI options, invalid configuration, or IO errors | | `101` | internal error |

ty supports two command line arguments that change how exit codes work:

- `--exit-zero`: ty will exit with `0` even if violations were found.
- `--error-on-warning`: ty will exit with `1` if it finds any violations with severity `warning` or higher.
