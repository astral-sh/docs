# [Excluding files](#excluding-files)

ty automatically discovers all Python files in your project. You can customize where ty searches by using the [`src.include`](../reference/configuration/#include) and [`src.exclude`](../reference/configuration/#exclude) settings.

For example, with the following configuration, ty checks all Python files in the `src` and `tests` directories except those in the `src/generated` directory:

pyproject.toml

```
[tool.ty.src]
include = ["src", "tests"]
exclude = ["src/generated"]

```

## [Default exclusions](#default-exclusions)

By default, ty excludes a [variety of commonly ignored directories](../reference/configuration/#exclude_1). If you want to include one of these directories, you can do so by adding a negative `exclude` using a leading `!`:

pyproject.toml

```
[tool.ty.src]
# Remove `build` from the excluded directories.
exclude = ["!**/build/"]

```

By default, ty ignores files listed in an `.ignore` or `.gitignore` file. To disable this functionality, set [`respect-ignore-files`](../reference/configuration/#respect-ignore-files) to `false`.

## [Explicit targets](#explicit-targets)

You may explicitly pass the paths that ty should check, e.g.:

```
ty check src scripts/benchmark.py

```

Paths that are passed as positional arguments to `ty check` are included even if they would otherwise be ignored through `exclude` filters or an ignore-file.

## [Include and exclude syntax](#include-and-exclude-syntax)

Both `include` and `exclude` support gitignore like glob patterns:

- `src/` matches a directory (including its contents) named `src`.
- `src` matches a file or directory (including its contents) named `src`.
- `*` matches any (possibly empty) sequence of characters (except `/`).
- `**` matches zero or more path components. This sequence **must** form a single path component, so both `./**a` and `./b**/` are invalid and will result in an error. A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also invalid.
- `?` matches any single character except `/`
- `[abc]` matches any character inside the brackets. Character sequences can also specify ranges of characters, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g. `[0-9]` specifies any character between `0` and `9` inclusive. An unclosed bracket is invalid.

All patterns are anchored: The pattern `src` only includes `<project_root>/src` but not something like `<project_root>/test/src`. To include any directory named `src`, use the prefix match `**/src`. The same applies for exclude patterns where `src` only excludes `<project_root>/src` but not something like `<project_root>/test/src`.

Warning

A prefix include pattern like `**/src` can notably slow down the Python file discovery.

All fields accepting patterns use the reduced portable glob syntax from [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/#add-license-FILES-key), with the addition that characters can be escaped with a backslash.

## [Excluding files from virtual environments](#excluding-files-from-virtual-environments)

In Python 3.13+, the `venv` module will add a `.gitignore` file to the virtual environment root and ty will not emit diagnostics for the contained files. However, when using an older version of Python, ty may include diagnostics for files in the virtual environment.

You can resolve this by adding a `.gitignore` to the environment, e.g., for a virtual environment named `.venv`:

```
echo "*" > .venv/.gitignore

```

Or by adding your virtual environment to your `.gitignore` or `.ignore` file.
