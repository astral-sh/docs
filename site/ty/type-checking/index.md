# [Type checking](#type-checking)

After [installing ty](../installation/), it's time to type check some code!

## [Running the type checker](#running-the-type-checker)

To run the type checker, use the `check` command:

```
ty check

```

Tip

If you're in a project, you may need to use `uv run` or activate your virtual environment first for ty to find your dependencies.

## [Environment discovery](#environment-discovery)

The type checker needs to discover your installed packages in order to check your use of imported dependencies.

ty will find installed packages in the active virtual environment (via `VIRTUAL_ENV`) or discover a virtual environment named `.venv` in the project root or working directory. It will not find packages in non-virtual environments without specifying the target path with `--python`.

See the [module discovery](../modules/) documentation for details.

## [File selection](#file-selection)

ty will run on all Python files in the working directory (including subdirectories, recursively). If used from a project, ty will run on all Python files in the project (starting in the directory with the `pyproject.toml`).

You can also provide specific paths to check:

```
ty check example.py

```

You can also persistently configure [included and excluded files](../exclusions/).

## [Rule selection and severity](#rule-selection-and-severity)

ty's type checking diagnostics are often associated with a rule.

ty's type checking rules can be configured to your project's needs. See the [rules](../rules/) documentation for details.

You can also suppress specific violations of rules using [suppression comments](../suppression/).

## [Watch mode](#watch-mode)

ty can be run in an incremental watch mode:

```
ty check --watch

```

ty will watch files for changes and recheck any affected files — including files that depend on the changed file. ty uses [fine-grained incrementality](../features/language-server/#fine-grained-incrementality) to perform subsequent checks much faster than running `ty check` repeatedly.

## [The type system](#the-type-system)

To learn more about what makes type checking in ty unique, read about the [type system](../features/type-system/).
