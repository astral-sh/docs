# [Suppression](#suppression)

Rules can also be ignored in specific locations in your code (instead of disabling the rule entirely) to silence false positives or permissible violations.

Note

To disable a rule entirely, set it to the `ignore` level as described in [rule levels](../rules/#rule-levels).

## [ty suppression comments](#ty-suppression-comments)

To suppress a rule violation inline add a `# ty: ignore[<rule>]` comment at the end of the line:

```
a = 10 + "test"  # ty: ignore[unsupported-operator]

```

Rule violations spanning multiple lines can be suppressed by adding the comment at the end of the violation's first or last line:

```
def sum_three_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int: ...

# on the first line

sum_three_numbers(  # ty: ignore[missing-argument]
    3,
    2
)

# or, on the last line

sum_three_numbers(
    3,
    2
)  # ty: ignore[missing-argument]

```

To suppress multiple violations on a single line, enumerate each rule separated by a comma:

```
sum_three_numbers("one", 5)  # ty: ignore[missing-argument, invalid-argument-type]

```

To suppress specific rules for an entire file, place a `# ty: ignore[<rule>]` comment on its own line before any Python code:

```
# ty: ignore[invalid-argument-type]

sum_three_numbers(3, 2, "1")

```

Note

Enumerating rule names (e.g., `[rule1, rule2]`) is optional. However, we strongly recommend including suppressing specific rules to avoid accidental suppression of other errors.

## [Standard suppression comments](#standard-suppression-comments)

ty supports the standard [`type: ignore`](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#type-ignore-comments) comment format introduced by PEP 484.

`type: ignore` suppresses all violations on that line.

`type: ignore[ty:<rule>]` behaves like `ty: ignore[<rule>]` and only suppresses the matching rule. Codes without a `ty:` prefix are ignored, which makes it possible to combine suppressions for multiple type checkers in a single comment.

```
# Ignore all typing errors on the next line
sum_three_numbers("one", 5)  # type: ignore

# Ignore a mypy code and a ty rule in the same comment
sum_three_numbers("one", 5, 2)  # type: ignore[arg-type, ty:invalid-argument-type]

```

## [Multiple suppressions comments](#multiple-suppressions-comments)

To suppress a typing error on a line that already has a suppression comment from another tool, add the `# ty: ignore` comment to the same line.

For example, to suppress a type error and disable formatting for a specific line:

```
result = calculate()  # ty: ignore[invalid-argument-type]  # fmt: skip

# or
result = calculate()  # fmt: off  # ty: ignore[invalid-argument-type]

```

## [Unused suppression comments](#unused-suppression-comments)

If the [`unused-ignore-comment`](../reference/rules/#unused-ignore-comment) rule is enabled, ty will report unused `ty: ignore` and `type: ignore` comments.

`unused-ignore-comment` violations can only be suppressed using `# ty: ignore[unused-ignore-comment]`. They cannot be suppressed using `# ty: ignore` without a rule code or `# type: ignore`.

## [`@no_type_check` directive](#no_type_check-directive)

ty supports the [`@no_type_check`](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#no-type-check) decorator to suppress all violations inside a function.

```
from typing import no_type_check

def sum_three_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    return a + b + c

@no_type_check
def main():
    sum_three_numbers(1, 2)  # no error for the missing argument

```

Decorating a class with `@no_type_check` isn't supported.
