# [Editor integration](#editor-integration)

ty can be integrated with various editors to provide a seamless development experience.

Learn more about ty's editor features in the [language server](../features/language-server/) documentation.

## [VS Code](#vs-code)

The Astral team maintains an official VS Code extension.

Install the [ty extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty) from the VS Code Marketplace.

The extension automatically disables the language server from the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) to avoid running two Python language servers. This is done by setting [`python.languageServer`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_intellisense-engine-settings) to `"None"` as a default configuration.

If you prefer to use ty only for type checking and want to use another language server for capabilities like hover, auto-completions, etc., you can override this by explicitly setting [`python.languageServer`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_intellisense-engine-settings) and [`ty.disableLanguageServices`](../reference/editor-settings/#disablelanguageservices) in your [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_settings-json-file):

```
{
  "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
  "ty.disableLanguageServices": true,
}

```

## [Neovim](#neovim)

The [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) extension is the recommended way of using ty with Neovim (if you prefer not to install the extension, you can copy [the ty configuration](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lsp/ty.lua) manually instead). After installing the nvim-lspconfig extension, you need to enable the language server (and can optionally configure additional settings). For Neovim >=0.11, you can add the following snippet to your config file:

```
-- Optional: Only required if you need to update the language server settings
vim.lsp.config('ty', {
  settings = {
    ty = {
      -- ty language server settings go here
    }
  }
})

-- Required: Enable the language server
vim.lsp.enable('ty')

```

For Neovim \<0.11, you would use the configuration below instead (note that [you might need to install an older version of nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig?tab=readme-ov-file#important-%EF%B8%8F)):

```
require('lspconfig').ty.setup({
  settings = {
    ty = {
      -- ty language server settings go here
    }
  }
})

```

## [Zed](#zed)

ty is included with Zed out of the box (no extension required), although the default primary LSP for Python is basedpyright.

You can enable ty and disable basedpyright by adding this to your `settings.json` file:

```
{
  "languages": {
    "Python": {
      "language_servers": [
        // Disable basedpyright and enable ty, and otherwise
        // use the default configuration.
        "ty",
        "!basedpyright",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

You can override the `ty` executable Zed uses by setting `lsp.ty.binary`:

```
{
  "lsp": {
    "ty": {
      "binary": {
        "path": "/home/user/.local/bin/ty",
        "arguments": ["server"]
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## [PyCharm](#pycharm)

Starting with version 2025.3, PyCharm users can enable native ty support in the settings:

1. Go to **Python | Tools | ty** in the Settings dialog.

1. Select the **Enable** checkbox.

1. In the Execution mode setting, select how PyCharm should search for the executable:

   **Interpreter** mode: PyCharm searches for an executable installed in your interpreter. To install the ty package for the selected interpreter, click *Install ty*.

   **Path** mode: PyCharm searches for an executable in `$PATH`. If the executable is not found, you can specify the path by clicking the Browse... icon.

1. Select which options should be enabled.

For more information, refer to [PyCharm documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/lsp-tools.html#ty).

## [Other editors](#other-editors)

ty can be used with any editor that supports the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

To start the language server, use the `server` subcommand:

```
ty server

```

Refer to your editor's documentation to learn how to connect to an LSP server.

## [Settings](#settings)

See the [editor settings reference](../reference/editor-settings/) for more details on configuring the language server.
